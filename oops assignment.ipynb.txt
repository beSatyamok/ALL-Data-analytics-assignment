Polymorphism in Python allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass, particularly when inheritance is involved. It enables a single interface (method name) to represent different underlying forms (method implementations).\n","\n",". Concept:\n","\n","When a child class inherits from a parent class, it can override methods of the parent.\n","Polymorphism allows you to call the same method on different objects — and each object responds in its own way.\n","\n",".Example:"],"metadata":{"id":"PmGFe5Mpu7Ec"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["class Animal:\n","    def sound(self):\n","        return \"Some generic sound\"\n","\n","class Dog(Animal):\n","    def sound(self):\n","        return \"Bark\"\n","\n","class Cat(Animal):\n","    def sound(self):\n","        return \"Meow\"\n","\n","# Using polymorphism\n","animals = [Dog(), Cat(), Animal()]\n","\n","for animal in animals:\n","    print(animal.sound())\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"-9DvvhXewVky","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1759892322130,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":57,"user":{"displayName":"Swarndeep Choudhary","userId":"12382995851175050689"}},"outputId":"75156fa3-dca0-40fa-fd08-003fd3c4dedf"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Bark\n","Meow\n","Some generic sound\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":[".
